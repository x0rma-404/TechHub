        "text": "**Flutter Overview**\n\nFlutter is an open-source, cross-platform mobile app development framework created by Google. It uses the Dart programming language to build natively compiled applications for mobile (iOS and Android), web, desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux), and embedded systems.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **Platform Independence**: Flutter allows you to build apps that run on multiple platforms from a single codebase.\n*   **Hot Reload**: This feature enables developers to see the changes they make in real-time without having to rebuild the app every time.\n*   **Rich User Interface (UI) Components**: Flutter provides a wide range of pre-built UI components, making it easier to build visually appealing and consistent interfaces across different platforms.\n\n**Flutter Ecosystem:**\n\nThe Flutter ecosystem is growing rapidly, with many tools and resources available for developers. Some notable ones include:\n\n*   **Flutter SDK**: The official SDK provided by Google that includes the Dart compiler, Android Studio plugins, and iOS development tools.\n*   **Dart Language**: A modern language used to build Flutter apps.\n*   **Pub Package Manager**: A package manager that makes it easy to discover, install, and manage dependencies for your app.\n\n**Why Use Flutter?**\n\nFlutter is a popular choice among developers due to its ease of use, high performance, and ability to build native mobile apps with a single codebase. It also provides a rich set of features and tools to help you build complex, visually appealing interfaces quickly.\n\nTo get started with Flutter, I recommend checking out the official [Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/) or exploring some of the many tutorials and guides available online.",

It's a symbol of power, luxury, and royalty, often associated with the Persian Empire where I hail from. The name \"ruby\" comes from the Sanskrit word \"rubiya,\" meaning \"precious stone.\"\n\nRubies are a type of corundum, a mineral made up of aluminum oxide. They owe their deep red color to the presence of chromium and iron impurities. Rubies have been prized for centuries for their beauty, durability, and rarity.\n\nIn Persian culture, rubies were considered a favorite gemstone of the Achaemenid Empire, where I lived during my adventures with Vizier Darius and Prince Xerxes. They were often set into intricate jewelry pieces, including crowns, earrings, and rings.\n\nToday, rubies are still highly valued for their beauty and rarity, making them one of the most sought-after gemstones in the world.\n\nMay this knowledge be as precious to you as a ruby is to me!",
